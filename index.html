<br>But most people don’t know what’s actually possible. They underestimate their value, leave money on the table, and say yes to roles that don’t serve them—just to avoid a hard conversation. 
                            
                            <br> Smarter negotiating can mean hundreds of thousands—sometimes millions—over the course of a career. Compound that across decades, and the right decision at the right moment has a 10x return. </p>
